Yashoda Hospital Data Analysis
** Project Highlight: Yashoda Hospital Data Analysis
I recently completed a data analysis project for Yashoda Hospital, utilizing Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Power BI for visualizations. The dataset, provided in Excel, was cleaned and processed in Python to uncover key insights into patient trends, healthcare operations, and hospital performance. My key contributions include:
üîç EDA using Python:
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Identified trends in patient admissions, treatments, and recovery times.
Visualized key statistics on patient demographics and disease distribution.
üìä Power BI Visualizations:
Created interactive dashboards for hospital management to track KPIs.
Visualized patient inflow,resource utilization across departments.
This project helped provide actionable insights to optimize hospital operations and enhance patient care.**
